# Detection of Pneumonia using ML & DL in Python

7% of the population or 450 million people worldwide are suffering from Pneumonia which results in
the death of 4 million people every year [1]. Pneumonia is an acute lower respiratory disease with
traces of infection usually because of some micro-organism, bacteria or virus. World health
organization (WHO) states that the pneumonia is the leading reason for the child dearth in the world. It
had killed approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five. And south Asia is leading the
table. South Asian countries like Indian Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia etc. have the most
no. children having pneumonia disease. Not only is this death rate of pneumonia greater than death rate
of other dangerous disease like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined [2]. Among children younger
than five years, pneumonia is considered as one of the deadliest diseases [3]. Only India has
encountered 158,176 deaths in the year 2016, and still India continue to show the significant no.in the
infant deaths because of pneumonia. According to WHO report published on World would be
consumed by this communicable disease [4]. In today’s time the most effective Pneumonia detection
method accepted by the doctors is radiograph. Although, some studies tell us that discrepancies are
usual in the interpretation of the chest radiographs via radiologist. This drawback of human based
observation has provided enough motivation to technology making interference in this field where
machine will classify between a normal X-ray and abnormal Chest X-ray. This provides accuracy and speed to the diagnosis process. [5] Our problem for this project is the “binary Classification” of the
input chest X-ray images and then classifies them between the two classes of pneumonia or non-
pneumonia. This project emphasizes upon the extensive use of neural networks in detection of
pneumonia in chest X-rays.
